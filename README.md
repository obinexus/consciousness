# Filter-Flash Consciousness Model

A computational implementation of the Filter-Flash model of consciousness, which posits that consciousness serves as a protective barrier that filters infinite information rather than a flashlight that gradually illuminates more information.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework and implementation of Nnamdi Okpala's Filter-Flash consciousness model, which offers a novel approach to understanding the "easy problem" of consciousness by emphasizing consciousness as a filtering mechanism rather than an information acquisition process.

### Key Concepts

- **Traditional Model** ("The Expanding Flashlight"): Consciousness starts with limited information and gradually gains access to more as we develop
- **Filter-Flash Model** ("The Protective Barrier"): Consciousness starts with unlimited information and develops filters to prevent overwhelm

## Cognitive Filter-Flash DAG

The `cognitive_ff_dag` package implements a Bayesian Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) approach to modeling the Filter-Flash consciousness theory. It supports:

- **FilterFlash processing**: Bottom-up processing from sensory inputs to meaning (filtering)
- **FlashFilter processing**: Top-down processing from insights to verification (flashing)
- **Gamma wave simulation**: Modeling "aha moments" through threshold-based activation
- **Bayesian inference**: Probability-based reasoning with belief updates
- **Enhanced visualizations**: Visual representations of the cognitive model with entropy encoding

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib networkx
   ```
3. Run the example:
   ```bash
   cd consciousness/cognitive_ff_dag/examples
   python color_classification_example.py
   ```

## The Filter-Flash Theory

The Filter-Flash model separates consciousness into two distinct processes:

1. **Filtering**: Organizing overwhelming information through classification by properties
2. **Flashing**: Bringing organized information into consciousness in structured form

This model addresses the objective problem of consciousness by:
- Viewing consciousness as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon
- Providing a protective barrier mechanism to prevent information overload
- Supporting both bottom-up and top-down processing
